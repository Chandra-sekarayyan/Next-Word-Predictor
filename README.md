Next Word Prediction Web App (LSTM + Flask)

This is an AI-powered web application that predicts the next most probable word in a sentence using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. It offers real-time predictions with an interactive, user-friendly frontend and a Flask backend.

📌 Features

- 🔠 Predicts the next word based on the typed context
- 📊 Displays top 5 word suggestions with confidence scores
- ⚡ Real-time, dynamic predictions using AJAX (JavaScript Fetch API)
- 🧠 LSTM model trained using Keras and TensorFlow
- 🌐 Responsive frontend with modern glassmorphism UI
- 🔁 Sentence-building interface where suggestions update contextually

🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras** — model development and training
- **Flask** — lightweight web backend
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** — frontend development
- **Pickle** — to serialize tokenizer and model configuration
- **Google Colab** — training environment with GPU acceleration
